1. Create a website at [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com)
2. Create a folder in drive which contains your Google Site / Move it to this folder
3. Use [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout) to download the Google Site (normal download doesn't work): Deselect all, select Drive, click 'All Drive data included', Deselect all, select your folder containing the website
4. Create a Github repository named YourAccountName.github.io and make sure it is public and enforces https (check the boxes).
5. Extract the zip file from Google Takeout and navigate to your folder: Takeout>Drive>(DriveFolder)>GoogleSitesFolder
6. Open either your DRAFT or PUBLISHED folder for your website
7. Make a copy the "Home.html" file and rename it to "index.html" - The capitalization may be important, write with lowercase to be safe. You should have both Home.html and index.html in the folder.
8. Upload everything in the folder to your Github repository (YourAccountName.github.io)
9. Your files be used by Github pages automatically in this repository. The webpage will be accessable via https://YourAccountName.github.io. It may take some time to fully upload (should be max 15 minutes).
10. Add your domain name (the text you write as the web adress) to the website by following the guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX4w9hsduNA
